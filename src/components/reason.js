			<h1>Why I want to join IEEE?</h1>
			<p>
				From ups and downs I got through my experiences, I learned much about the importance of
				having good work ethics, communication skills, and professionalism. Hence, I want to be a
				professional person with good work ethics, good attitudes to others, and sharp skills. To
				reach that point, I should get out of my comfort zone, and shape myself to be the best that I
				can. In short, I want to grow up to my fullest potential.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, known as IEEE, is a professional international organization, 
				with a broad disciple of technology (known as societies). 
				IEEE has so many contributions in shaping the world through technological advancement.
			</p>
			<p>
				As far as I know, IEEE ITB SB is acknowledged as a professional organization, with all of those
				awards and international recognition. I believe there is professional work ethics inside IEEE ITB SB officers that brings them to
				successfully running big projects, networking with big companies, and winning many achievements until now.
			</p>
			<p>
				IEEE ITB SB is the right
				place to help me reach my goals. By joining IEEE ITB SB, I expect to understand the real
				definition of professional, develop good attitudes, and reach my full potential. I also hope that
				I could improve my skills, especially those that align with my field of interest. 
			</p>
			<p>
				This will be a long and rough journey, but I will do my best.
			</p>

			<h2>Dream Team?</h2>
			<p>
				An ideal team for me is a team that radiates positive energy. 
				I work well in a team that consists of active, responsible, and enthusiastic people. 
				I hope that I could have good teamwork and get along well with my team, no matter where they came from, 
				or their preferences of something or anything.
				I also hope that everyone in the team have a proper understanding or respecting each other.
				When there is a problem in our work, we could talk and solve it together.
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm pretty agile so the rest are pretty flexible, like personal preferences of 
				my teammate etc., but as a person who dreams of balanced life, 
				I don't want to overwork myself, especially if I shouldn't have to.
